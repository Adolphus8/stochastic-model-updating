The work proposes a stochastic model updating framework which involves the use of the [Jensen-Shannon divergence](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.107954) as the distance function, and the [Transtional Ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TEMCMC)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108471) and the sampler to obtain posterior estimates.

The proposed framework as thus far been implemented to address the following problems:
